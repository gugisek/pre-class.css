# pre-class.css
Simple pre-classes for HTML, easy use and implement

To use this css file:
1. Download and put it in your website directory
2. Paste in head and edit: < link rel="stylesheet" href="your_location_of_file/pre-class.css" >

There is no documentation for now, so you must search in file to know names of classes.
I plan to add website in future, but now must add classes for resposible design.
